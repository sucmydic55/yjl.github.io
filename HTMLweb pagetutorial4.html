<font size=4>One day while <u>grazing</u> the sheep, he shouted, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" Farmers working in the nearby fields came running for help but didn't find any wolf.</font>
</p>


<p align=justify>
<font size=4>The boy laughed and replied, "It was just fun. There is no wolf here".</font> <font size=5><b><em>The boy played a similar trick repeatedly for many days.</font></b></em>
